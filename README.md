# JUnit-StartingProject

Welcome to our JUnit Testing Playground! Here, we've created an environment to showcase the versatility of JUnit for testing Java applications.
Our project includes a diverse set of tests that assess functionality, edge cases, and integration scenarios.

## What You'll Find:

- **Parameterized Tests:** See how JUnit's parameterized tests allow us to run the same test logic with different inputs.
- **Test Suites:** Explore test suites that group related tests, offering a structured approach to testing different aspects of our application.
- **Assertions Galore:** From simple assertions to more complex ones, we've leveraged JUnit's assertion capabilities to validate expected outcomes.

Feel free to clone the repository, experiment with the code, and discover the world of JUnit testing. Let's ensure our code stands strong against any challenge!

Happy Testing!
